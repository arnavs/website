I'm teaching a class on _computational, behavioral economics_. Details are below; signup link is [here]()

tl/dr
  - **Class**: Learn behavioral economics using math and code. Model and implement an economic/social situation you're interested in. 
  - **Time**: Tuesdays 7-9PM. 
  - **Duration**: 7 weeks, from 1.20.26 to 3.3.26 (skipping 2.17.26)
  - **Location**: Lower Manhattan (in-person only)
  - **Cost**: $120 (scholarship), $210 (standard), $300 (supporter). Send me an email if none of these work.

### Summary 

Over 7 weeks, we're going to use modern machinery (math and code) to explore behavioral economics. By the end, you'll have written a small interactive paper[^1] where you apply these tools to a problem you're interested in. 

"Economics" means that people are trying to maximize something, subject to some constraint. It may sound rigid (and we'll explore the limits), but this framework is already very permissive. People could be deciding: 
  * Whether or not to accept a job, or wait for a better offer tomorrow. 
  * How much lying they can get away with before reputation effects kick in and punish them. 
  * If it's best to follow the crowd, or act on their own beliefs. 

"Behavioral" means that people are not the [precisely rational creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus) required by neoclassical theory. They might [make mistakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trembling_hand_perfect_equilibrium) when carrying out their plans. They might not be perfect Bayesians (we'll discuss what that means), or they might face computational limits on the amount of information they can process. 

An increasingly large part of modern economics is realizing that these "behavioral frictions" aren't just small annoyances that we can model away. In many cases they lead to startlingly different behavior. 

But we can't see clearly what that behavior is by sticking to the "literary" economics of (say) Keynes. We need to model people mathematically, and then implement our models on a computer.  

### Requirements

### Class Format 

Each class will be 1.5 hours of new material, followed by at least 0.5 hours of coworking and ``office hours.'' (There's no hard stop after 0.5 hours.)

Office hours are a good time to get help from me (and other students) on your individual projects. 

There will be homework, but no grades. 

Once everyone is registered, I'll make a GitHub repo for the class. The GitHub will be our main digital space/sandbox. 

After the class is over, anyone who wants to can remove their material or interim products, and I'll turn it public.
