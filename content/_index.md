I'm a third-year PhD student in economics at Carnegie Mellon. 

My research is on how learning and experimentation changes traditional economic stories (e.g. persuasion, monopoly pricing, macro dynamics.)

I've worked as a volunteer developer for [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), and currently maintain software packages like [Expectations.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/Expectations.jl) and [InstantiateFromURL.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/InstantiateFromURL.jl) 

I'm an OCD survivor (2013-2023) --- if you or someone you know wants someone to talk to, send me an email.
