I'm a first-year PhD student in economics at Carnegie Mellon. My general interests are in computational macroeconomics, and especially high-dimensional models with heterogeneity in information.

Previously, I was a predoc at UBC, where I worked extensively with [Jesse Perla](https://www.jesseperla.com/) on topics like [high-dimensional dynamic programming](https://www.jesseperla.com/publication/symmetry-dynamic-programming/) and [HACT](https://github.com/jlperla/PerlaTonettiWaugh.jl) models.

I also volunteer for the [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) organization, where I help with teaching, open-source development, and internal infrastructure.

My email's [arnav@arnavsood.com](mailto:arnav@arnavsood.com). If you prefer to communicate securely, here's my PGP [public key](https://gist.github.com/arnavs/53414fd9d4f9c27f6a9bdfdeb906a751).
