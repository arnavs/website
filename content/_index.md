I'm a first-year PhD student in economics at Carnegie Mellon. 

I'm into computational macroeconomics, and especially high-dimensional models with heterogeneity in information.

Previously, I was a predoc at UBC, where I worked with [Jesse Perla](https://www.jesseperla.com/) on topics like [high-dimensional dynamic programming](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28981) and [HACT](https://github.com/jlperla/PerlaTonettiWaugh.jl) models. 

I've worked as a volunteer developer for [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), and maintain software packages like [Expectations.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/Expectations.jl).
