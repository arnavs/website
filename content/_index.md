I'm a second-year PhD student in economics at Carnegie Mellon. 

I'm into computational macroeconomics, and especially questions involving sufficient statistics and learning.

Previously, I was a predoc at UBC, where I worked with [Jesse Perla](https://www.jesseperla.com/) on topics like [high-dimensional dynamic programming](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28981).

I've worked as a volunteer developer for [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), and maintain software packages like [Expectations.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/Expectations.jl).
