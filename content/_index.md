I'm a fourth-year PhD student in economics at Carnegie Mellon. 

My interests are in micro theory, and especially information design for behavioral agents and non-Bayesian learning in games. I try to integrate statistical learning and decision-making with traditional economic settings. 

Previously, I was a volunteer developer for [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org), where I created software packages like [Expectations.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/Expectations.jl) and [InstantiateFromURL.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/InstantiateFromURL.jl)
