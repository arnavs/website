      <description>Some notes on hikes and backcountry situations.
Eye of the Sandias (08/2025, NM): We did this at 1:30PM in late August. Had about 2L of water (between the two of us) + a water bottle. Near the end of the uphill portion I was drinking every 0.1-0.2 miles. We got lost on the way down (phone batteries depleted rapidly in the heat), and had to scramble down the other side of the mountain, where there is no trail or hikes.</description>
